      <p id="right">At any given moment, hundreds of things are happening instantaneously. My passion is to deepen our thinking and understanding about which of these "things" grab our attention longer than others. 
          In our society, the pace of life is typically extremely fast. What makes us stop for a moment or two? To take an extra glance, to stop and appreciate or consider something we see?
          I believe photography can be a great tool to assist us in answering these questions. As you move about your daily life, pause and reflect on what grabs you. Capture it. Share it. Know that only 
          you saw it that exact way and other people appreciate you sharing your perspective.</p>

      <p id="left">The best definition of photography is painting with light. It is both informational and magical.
        It is true that the way you tell your story in a photograph is by manipulating the light.
        Do you dare point the lense directly at the light source? Do you only reveal a small fraction of your subject? You, the photographer have the power
        to show as much or as little of something. Take a closer look, take more looks, change your positioning in regards to the light source.
        You might see something new or something old in a new way. Now, after you "see" it, capture it and share it with others.</p>
